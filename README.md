# Visual-Pumping-Lemma
The Visual Pumping Lemma Demonstrator is an interactive Streamlit-based educational tool that helps users understand Regular and Context-Free pumping lemmas through visualization. It tests strings, shows decompositions, generates pumped strings, and provides analysis and counterexamples, making formal language theory easier to learn.
